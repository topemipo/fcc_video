I’m dealing with a legal situation, and I’d like your opinion on what the potential verdict might be if I decide to take this case to court again.So, here's what happened. Back in 1961, I got a job as an officer at the bank. Things were going fine, and in 1968, I got promoted to work in the Foreign Exchange Department at the bank's head office.

Around 1964, I helped start a housing society. The idea was to build homes for bank employees. I was one of the main people running it, and later I became the secretary. But after some time, there were complaints about the way the society's money was being handled. They said there was some mismanagement or missing money.

The Registrar, who oversees these kinds of societies, started an investigation in 1969. They had someone look into it, and in their report, they said I and two other people had been careless with the funds, causing a big loss—over ₹3.5 lakh. Later, the Registrar asked another officer to check the exact losses.

Meanwhile, the bank found out about this, and they gave me a notice in December 1969, asking me to explain myself. I replied in January 1970, saying I didn’t agree with the findings and questioned the investigation’s fairness.

In March 1970, one of the other members of the society, who also worked at the bank, filed a criminal complaint. He accused me and the other two of stealing money—₹51,000 and ₹80,000—from the society. I was charged with criminal breach of trust. While this was going on, the bank suspended me in November 1970, saying my actions involved serious misconduct.

By 1971, the investigation by the Registrar’s officer concluded that I owed the society over ₹2.36 lakh, in addition to what I was already held responsible for earlier. Because of this, the bank decided to terminate my job starting December 1971, and they gave me notice pay. I protested, saying this was unfair and that I wasn’t even given a proper hearing. But they didn’t change their decision.

Then, in 1972, I was convicted in the criminal case. I appealed to the High Court, and thankfully, in 1973, they overturned the conviction and said I was not guilty. They even suggested the bank should reconsider reinstating me. So, I sent multiple requests to the bank, asking for my job back, but they refused every time.

I finally went to court, and a judge sided with me, saying the termination wasn’t fair. But the bank appealed, and the higher court dismissed my case, saying I waited too long to take action and that the bank was justified in their decision. Now, I’m here trying to challenge that ruling because I still feel what happened to me was unjust.
