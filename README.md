# Notes 

Used "ext-embedding-3-small" at first and it wasn't giving me the right responses. It was responding with case docs that didn't exist in my knowledge base. 

I then changed to "ext-embedding-ada-002" and reduced my query length and i got the result i wanted.


i'm thinking of changing the embedding process used form the video. It's not generating embeddings for me. anytime i print out my embeddings, they come out as none.
